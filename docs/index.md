### About me
I am an indefinite FC2 postdoctoral researcher at Instituto de Astrofísica de Canarias (IAC), funded by the ERC Synergy Grant “Whole Sun” since December 2023. Previously, I held a 3-year postdoctoral position at the Rosseland Centre for Solar Physics (RoCS), University of Oslo (2018–2021), where I continue as a Guest Researcher since 2021. My work combines advanced radiative-MHD simulations, space- and ground-based observations, code development, and, more recently, machine-learning techniques to investigate fundamental phenomena in the solar atmosphere.

#### Papers
39 papers in refereed journals. 936 citations. H-index: 18. riq-index = 146, tori-index = 2.1.
