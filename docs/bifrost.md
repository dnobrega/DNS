# Welcome to D. Nobrega-Siverio's webpage

## Bifrost

The paper explaing the code can be found in the following link:

[Gudiksen et al. (2011)](https://www.aanda.org/articles/aa/pdf/2011/07/aa16520-11.pdf)

## Getting Bifrost

Bifrost is located on github. The repository is private, meaning you
should be logged in with your github username to see it at:

[Bifrost repository](https://github.com/ITA-Solar/Bifrost)

To get started with the new repository, you'll need to have git
(pre-installed in most machines) and configure it to use your name and
email address you registered with github, by doing something like:

> `git config --global user.name "Daniel Nobrega"`  
> `git config --global user.email dnobrega@example.com`

You can clone the repository through HTTPS like this:

> `git clone https://username@github.com/ITA-Solar/Bifrost.git`

replacing "username" with your github username.

## Terminal configuration

In your home directory, create (or modify) your .login file to add the following system variables.
In case of working with tcsh:

> `setenv BIFROST "/folder/Bifrost"`  
> `setenv BIFROST_IDL $BIFROST"/IDL"`  

where _folder_ is the location where you have cloned the Bifrost repository.
It is also necessary to define a system variable called OSC_CSTAGGER 
depending on your operative system

> `setenv OSC_CSTAGGER $BIFROST_IDL"/cstagger/linux"` - if you use a Linux system  
> `setenv OSC_CSTAGGER $BIFROST_IDL"/cstagger/intelmac"` - in case of a intelmac


You can also add an alias so you can go the Bifrost folder easily.
In case	of working with	tcsh:

> `alias bifrost "cd /folder/Bifrost/"`

## Stagger configuration

Next step is to go to your stagger folder, typing in your terminal

> `cd $OSC_CSTAGGER`

and then

> `make`

That would create the following six files:

* cstagger.pro
* cstagger.c
* cstagger.o
* init_stagger.o
* inverse.o
* cstagger.so

which are necessary for stagger operations
