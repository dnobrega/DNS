# SDO

The Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) is a NASA satellite, considered to be a second-generation solar mission (also referred to as SOHO successor). Launched on February 11 (2010), SDO represents the first mission within NASA's LWS (Living With a Star) program, a space weather-focused and applications-driven research program. The goal of LWS is to understand the sun as a magnetic variable star and to measure its impact on life and society on Earth.
