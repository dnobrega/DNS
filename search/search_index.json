Within DNS_PROJECTS , other folders will be automatically created with the name of the simulation when you save a image or movie. Using DNS routines \u00b6 Within a folder with a Bifrost experiment, run SSWIDL . The first plot we are going to create is a density plot: dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 0 where you have to modify snapt variable with the number of snapshot you want to plot. In case of a 3D run, by default it will show the \"XZ\" plane along the whole Y-direction. You can modify which slices you want to show, e.g., dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 0 , iy0 = 10 , iyf = 100 , iystep = 2 will show from index 10 to index 100 in Y-direction each two indexes. In case you want a specific slice in Y-direction, use iyt , e..g, dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 0 , iyt = 300 , / png In this case we have also added the png flag to save the image as a .png file in DNS_PROJECTS folder. You can also plot animations moving in time as follows: dns_plot, \"r\" ,snap0 = 0 , snapf = 500 , step = 10 , iyt = 300 That will show the XZ plane of the simulation in the index 300 of the Y-direction from snapshot 0 to snapshot 500 each 10 snapshots. You can save the previous animation, writing dns_plot, \"r\" ,snap0 = 0 , snapf = 500 , step = 10 , iyt = 300 , / movie, / setplot That will create a movie in your DNS_PROJECTS folder. The setplot flag is to create the movie using the Z buffer device. In 3D experiments you can plot different planes, for example, dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 100 , dim = \"yz\" , ixstep = 10 which will show the YZ plane each 10 indexes in X-direction. You can do the same for XY, dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 100 , dim = \"xy\" , izstep = 10 You can customize your window size, thickness, colors, position of the plot... For instance, dns_plot, \"r\" ,snapt = 100 , dim = \"xy\" , izstep = 10 , xsize = 1200 , ysize = 600 , load = 39 , position = [ 0.14 , 0.08 , 0.92 , 0.74 ] Once you are happy with your plot setup, you can save it, so you will not need to write all the commands again.
